This happens when an aircraft drops off passengers at their destination and returns home "empty", or when it flies "empty" to pick up passengers at another airport. It is estimated that one in three private jet trips are empty legs. <br /> <br /> Booking an empty leg is a much more affordable solution than booking a regular charter flight since discounts on empty legs vary between 30-70% compared to regular charter flights. The initial client has already paid for the empty leg when booking their trip, so the fixed cost of the flight is covered.
