This happens when an aircraft drops off passengers at their destination and returns home "empty", or when it flies "empty" to pick up passengers at another airport. It is estimated that one in three private jet trips are empty legs. <br /> <br /> Booking an empty leg is a much more affordable solution than booking a regular charter flight since discounts on empty legs vary between 30-70% compared to regular charter flights. The initial client has already paid for the empty leg when booking their trip, so the fixed cost of the flight is covered. Therefore, the operator can allow other passengers to fly on this aircraft at bargain prices.',category:"Chartering"},{title:"What are the restrictions of flying on empty legs?",content:"The first and major restriction with empty legs is availability because these flights are not immediately available when and where they are needed. Therefore, luck defines whether an aircraft will be available for your requested destination at your preferred time.<br /> <br /> JetSupply’s Advisors regularly observes on the market and do our best to accommodate your request. The next restriction is type of aircraft since it is chosen by the original passenger.
